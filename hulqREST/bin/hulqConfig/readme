hulqBASH testing settings files definitions:
===============================================================
1: the file name MUST be the file extension of the source type 
	to be added to the system. 
2: the file MUST contain the following fields:
	type="" 
		compiled (eg: c, c++, java, etc.)
		interpreted (eg: python, javascript, php, etc.)
	customOut=""
		y (output file can be defined by hulqBASH)
		n (output file is defined by compiler)	
	outFile=""
		$inFileName (the full filename of the submitted source)
		${inFileName%$".java"} (full filename -.java)		
		${inFileName%$".cs"}.exe (full filename -.cs +.exe)
		
	compiler=""
		(eg: gcc -o, g++ -o, javac, mcs, etc.)
		(RULES: if output file can be defined by hulqBASH then the
			then the compiler flag MUST be set in the compiler line, 
			eg: gcc -o, g++ -o)
	executor=""
		(eg: ./, java, mono, etc.)
		(RULES: no whitespace will  be inserted after the executor
			so if it is required, it must be defined
			eg: "./test.out" VS. "java test")
